- Worked in a software development agency where I took part in developing tailored software according to clients' business requirements.
- Collaborated with product managers to re‑architect a multipage web‑app to a single page app, boosting yearly revenue by over 30%.
- Tested software for bugs and operating performance, added documentation and fxed bugs to increase efciency by 15%.
- Suggested using the appropriate technologies and tools per project which in turn increased time to production by over 2 weeks.
