- Worked in a software development agency where I took part in developing tailored software according to clients' business requirements.
- Collaborated with product managers to re‑architect a multipage web‑app to a single page app, boosting yearly revenue by over 30%.
- Implemented CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and GitHub Actions which enabled rapid prototyping and improved
time‑to‑market by more than 50%.
- Tested software for bugs and operating performance using tools like Jest, unittest and selenium, added documentation, and fixed bugs to increase efficiency by over 35%.
- Suggested using the appropriate technologies and tools per project which in turn increased time to production by over 2 weeks.
