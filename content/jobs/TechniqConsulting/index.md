- Working on the implementation team, mostly developing clients' software projects using technologies depending on their specifications.
- Aside from being a part of the implementation team, I was also responsible for choosing the technologies used for each project. Allocating suitable tech stacks for projects led to them moving into production 1.5 times faster.
- Thanks to my broad expertise, clients requirements were more easily understood and properly implemented. This led to a noticeable increase in customer satisfaction and hence customer base.
